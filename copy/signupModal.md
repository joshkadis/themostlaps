We'll get stats for all the laps you've ridden since you joined Strava and update them **automatically** after every ride. You only need to sign up once!

Don't worry if you don't see your stats right away. We're pulling in your new rides and your old stats will show up soon.

(If you're a free Strava user, we can't get your old stats and we're working on a magic way to get your stats from new rides. Sign up anyway!)
