First off, thanks so much for signing up. I didn't expect to see so many people riding so many laps, so this all pretty exciting for me. If you have any questions or if something seems broken, your stats aren't updating, etc., please [let me know](mailto:info@themostlaps.com).

Next up, I'm pretty sure there are lots of folks who ride laps and use Strava that aren't on the site yet. Help me find them! **Please tell your friends, teammates, classmates, and roommates.** And don't forget to follow @themostlaps on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/themostlaps) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/themostlaps).

In other laps-related news...

### Congrats Allen

With 172 laps, [Allen Carr](https://themostlaps.com/rider/263657) was the lap leader for April 2018. That's roughly the distance from Brooklyn to Myrtle Beach, SC. Nice work!

### Giro Laps

A new leaderboard is coming soon, counting only laps ridden during the Giro (excluding rest days). There might even be a prize, who knows.

### Other upcoming stuff

* More rankings and filters like Early Bird (laps before 7am), Most Consistent (lowest std deviation from avg lap time), and other features if I think of anything (and have time)
* Graphs and visualizations of aggregated laps from the whole community
* Some secret stuff I think will be pretty cool
* PLEASE SEND ME YOUR IDEAS (info@themostlaps.com)

That's all for now. See you out there.

&dash; Josh
