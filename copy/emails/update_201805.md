Thanks so much for checking out The Most Laps. I didn't expect to see so many people join so quickly, so this all pretty exciting.

If you have ideas for new features or stats, something seems broken, your stats aren't updating, or you have any questions, [please let me know](mailto:info@themostlaps.com). Thanks!

### Congrats Allen

With 172 laps, [Allen Carr](https://themostlaps.com/rider/263657) was the lap leader for April 2018. That's roughly the distance from Brooklyn to Myrtle Beach, SC. Nice work Allen! Check out last month's [final rankings](https://themostlaps.com/ranking/2018/04).

### Giro di Laps

There's a [new leaderboard](https://themostlaps.com/ranking/giro2018) for laps ridden during the Giro (not counting rest days). There will be _modest_ prizes to the Top 3. Forza!

### Spread the word

Do you know anyone who rides in Prospect Park, uses Strava, and isn't on The Most Laps yet? **Please tell your friends, teammates, roommates, etc.** And don't forget to follow @themostlaps on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/themostlaps) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/themostlaps).

That's all for now. See you out there.
