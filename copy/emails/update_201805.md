First off, thanks so much for signing up. I didn't expect to see so many people so quickly, so this all pretty exciting.

If you have ideas for new features or stats, something seems broken, your stats aren't updating, or you have any questions, [please let me know](mailto:info@themostlaps.com). Thanks!

### Congrats Allen

With 172 laps, [Allen Carr](https://themostlaps.com/rider/263657) was the lap leader for April 2018. That's roughly the distance from Brooklyn to Myrtle Beach, SC. Nice work!

### Giro Laps

A new leaderboard is coming soon for laps ridden during the Giro (not counting rest days). There might even be a prize, who knows.

### Spread the word

Do you know anyone who rides laps, uses Strava, and isn't on The Most Laps yet? **Please tell your friends, teammates, roommates, etc.** And don't forget to follow @themostlaps on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/themostlaps) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/themostlaps).

That's all for now. See you out there.

&dash; Josh
