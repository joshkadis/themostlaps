## Infrequently Asked Questions

#### What's this all about?

As a cyclist in New York City, you probably spend a lot of time riding around Prospect Park or Central Park. Now there's a leaderboard for that.

This brings up an important point: NYC is home to the most diverse community of cyclists in the world but they're not all on Strava. So take these rankings with a grain of salt because the true lap leaders have been out there for decades.

#### How is this different from Local Legends on Strava?

Local Legends counts the last 90 for ton of random segments. The Most Laps goes all the way back to when you joined Strava and only counts the segments that _matter_.

#### Who can be on here?

Technically, any Strava user can sign up but it probably helps if you ride laps in Prospect Park or Central Park.

This site works best for paid Strava subscribers. If you're a free Strava user, [sign up anyway](#signup)! Strava doesn't give us as much information about your rides, but we're making the best of it.

#### Who made this?

The Most Laps was conceived, designed, and built by [Josh Kadis][1], a cyclist, web developer, and product manager from Brooklyn.

_"At first, I just wanted to use the Strava API to count all the Prospect Park laps I'd ridden. Then I quit my job and had some time on my hands, and things went from there..."_

#### How can I contact you?

[Email][6] or [Instagram][8], take your pick. We are particularly interested in sponsorships, freelance projects, and job offers. 😀

#### How does it work?

When you sign up, you authorize The Most Laps to access your Strava data. Then we look back through your past [segment efforts][2] and calculate your all-time, yearly, and monthly totals, and the most laps you've done in a single ride.

Whenever you have a new ride on Strava, we automatically count the laps and add them to your stats.

#### How does it really work?

Nextjs, a bunch of Node stuff, and MongoDB. If that's what you mean.

#### Where is my profile page?

There's no page on The Most Laps that "knows" if you're logged in. To find the public page with your stats, click the **Riders** link at the top of the page and search for yourself.

#### What personal information do you store?

From your Strava profile, we store your user id, first and last names, a link to your profile photo, and your email address. (Note: If you signed up after January 15, 2019, we don't have your email address.)

We don't share your personal info with anyone. Why would we?

#### What about private rides?

Private rides (or "activities" in Strava's technical terminology) _are_ included in your total stats. However, information that could identify any specific ride is _never_ displayed on the site.

#### Can you remove all my data from the site?

Yes, no problem. [Email us](mailto:info@themostlaps.com) and we'll take care of it right away.

If you revoke access in [your Strava settings][5], your data will be removed from the site automatically. If that doesn't happen, email and we'll fix it right away.
